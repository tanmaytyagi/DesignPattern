#1 : Clarifying Requirements :
------------------------------

1. Should the game support variable board sizes, such as 4x4 or 5x5 ?
    - No stick with 3x3

2. Should the game support both player-vs-player and player-vs-computer modes ?
    - player-vs-player only

3. What should happen if a player tries selecting an already filled cell?
    - reject the move and inform the player

4. Should the system maintain a scoreboard across multiple games to track player wins?
    - Yes, tracking score would be great addition

5. Should we track the history of moves to allow features like undo or move replay?
    - Interesting feature but leave it


Functional Requirements :
-------------------------

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take alternate turns, identified by markers ‘X’ and ‘O’
- The game should detect and announce the winner.
- The game should declare a draw if all cells are filled and no player has won.
- The game should reject invalid moves and inform the player.
- The system should maintain a scoreboard across multiple games.


Non-Functional Requirements :
-----------------------------

- The design should follow object-oriented principles with separation of concerns
- The system should be extensible to future features like larger boards, AI opponent, move history, etc.
- The system should provide clear console output that reflects the current state of the game board.



#2 : Identifying Core Entities :
--------------------------------

enums :
- Symbol        : 'X', 'O', '_'
- GameStatus    : 'IN_PROGRESS', 'WINNER_X', 'WINNER_O', 'DRAW'

Custom Exception :
- InvalidMoveException : extends RuntimeException

Data Classes :
- Player : immutable
- Cell : mutable

Interfaces :
- WinningStrategy : boolean checkWin(Board board, int row, int col, Symbol symbol);
- GameObserver : void update(Game game);

Strategy implementation :
- RowWinningStrategy
- ColumnWinningStrategy
- DiagonalWinningStrategy

Core Classes :
- Board class : encapsulates all grid operations
- Game class : The Game coordinates players, board, strategies, and observers

Observer Class :
- Scoreboard : listens for game end events and automatically updates scores

Singleton Facade :
- TicTacToeSystem : External code only needs to know about this class


#3 CODE implementation :
------------------------

Now let's translate our design into working code. We'll build bottom-up:
foundational types first, then data classes, then the classes with real logic.
This order matters because each layer depends on the ones below it.
